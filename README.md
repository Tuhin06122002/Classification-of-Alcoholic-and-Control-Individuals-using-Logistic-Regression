# Classification of Alcoholic and Control Individuals using Logistic Regression on EEG data

The electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is an electrical representation of the brainâ€™s working that 
reflects various physiological and pathological activities such as alcoholism. Alcohol can affect 
whole parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, and immune system; its effects on the brain can cause brain disorders. 

Nowadays, the automatic identification of alcoholic subjects based on EEG signals has become one of the challenging problems in
biomedical research. 

The goal of this project is to determine whether a person is an alcoholic or not, given the EEG data of that person. 
We do that by using logistic regression after some pre-processing using Principal Component Analysis. 

***Note: We are not taking an intoxicated person to the test, instead, we are testing whether an individual in a sober state is a habituated alcoholic or not.***
